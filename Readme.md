# __Unit Testing Practice Math Application - Test (TDD) Approach__

## __IMPLEMENTS: Object-Orientated Programming, Access Modifiers, Unit Testing__

A simple demo of using Test-Driven Development unit testing on a basic math class. The basic math class has four methods for addition, subtraction, divison, and multiplication. There is then one unit test for each method. This was done using the Test Driven Development approach so the tests were written first.
